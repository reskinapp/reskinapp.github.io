title: Installation
---

:::note
Due to the unique nature of its filesystem and package management, Reskin currently does not support NixOS.
:::

Reskin can be installed in 3 different ways outlined below. Before proceeding, please make sure you have installed all [prerequisites](/guides/prerequisites/).

### Pre-built Binary

This is the fastest and easiest way to get started. Simply download the pre-built binary and make it executable.

1. Go to the [releases](https://github.com/iamnotmega/reskin/releases) page

2. Download the binary

3. Make the binary executable:

```bash
chmod +x reskin
```

4. Run the binary:

```bash
./reskin
```

### Manual Installation

:::caution
This installation method is not recommended for beginners and should only be used by advanced users. If you are a beginner, we strongly suggest using a pre-built binary instead.
:::

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iamnotmega/reskin
```

2. Change to the cloned repository:

```bash
cd reskin/src-tauri
```

3. Install the Node modules:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Build the frontend:

```bash
npm run build
```

5. Build the binary:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

### AUR (Arch User Repository)

:::note
Please note that this method of installation only works on Arch Linux or distributions based on it.
:::

:::caution
There is a known issue where Reskin installations from the AUR may whitescreen and make the app completely unusable. To fix it, go to the [Reskin GitHub repository](https://github.com/iamnotmega/reskin) and download the latest binary available. Then copy it into `/usr/bin/` and make sure it's named `reskin`. This should fix the problem.
:::

1. If you haven't already, install an AUR helper like `yay`:

```bash
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git
cd yay
makepkg -si
```

2. Install Reskin:

```bash
yay -S reskin
```

For nightly preview builds, use:

```bash
yay -S reskin-git
```
