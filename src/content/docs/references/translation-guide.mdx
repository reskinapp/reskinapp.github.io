## Reskin Translation Guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Reskin! By providing a translation, you help bring the power of Reskin to a global audience.

:::note
Reskin version 1.5.0 or later is required to follow this guide. Please ensure the `package-lock.json`, `package.json`, `Cargo.toml` and `tauri.conf.json` files in your fork all have a version of `1.5.0` or above.
:::

## Prerequisites

Before starting your translation work, please ensure you meet the following requirements:

- GitHub Account: You must have a GitHub account to fork the repository and submit a Pull Request.

- Native Fluency: You should be a native or near-native speaker of the language you are translating to ensure accuracy and natural flow.

## How to Translate

The Reskin localization system (i18n) is designed for simplicity. All user-facing text is stored in separate, structured JSON files.

1. **Fork the Repository**

Start by forking the main `iamnotmega/reskin` repository on GitHub and clone it to your local machine.

2. **Locate the Language Folder**

Navigate to the source directory containing the language files in your forked repository:
```bash
cd /src/locales
```

3. **Create the New Translation File**

Create a new file in the `/src/locales` folder. The filename MUST be the two-letter ISO 639-1 language code followed by a `.json` extension (e.g., German should be `de.json`, Turkish should be `tr.json`). This standardized naming is required to ensure system consistency and maintainability.

4. **Copy the English Contents**

Copy ALL the content from the source file (`en.json`) and paste them into your new language file.

5. **Update the Metadata (_META)**

Edit the "_META" section at the very top of your new file to provide necessary documentation:

```json
  "_META": {
    "version": "1.5.0",
    "translators": ["YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME"], // Replace with your name/username
    "lastEdited": "2025/10/18",               // Replace with the date you finished
    "language": "Language Name"       // Replace with the full name of the language (e.g., "Türkçe")
  },
```

6. **Translate the Strings**

Go through the entire file and replace the strings of text in the file with the correct language equivalent.

:::caution
DO NOT change the key names (e.g., do not rename authmodal.title.login). Changing keys will break the application for that language.
:::

7. **Perform Final Review**

- Check your translated file carefully:

- Ensure all entries are still valid JSON (no trailing commas, correct quote usage).

- Verify all original keys have a corresponding translated string.

8. **Commit and Push**

Commit your new `<language-code>.json` file with a clear commit message. Then, push the changes to your forked repository.

9. **Create a Pull Request (PR)**

On GitHub, create a Pull Request targeting the `dev` branch of the main `iamnotmega/reskin` repository.

10. **Merge and Release**

The pull request will be reviewed to verify the quality of the translation, and merge your work into `dev`. Your translation will then be included in the next official Reskin release!

## Technical Reference

### Handling Variables

Some strings contain variables (e.g., `{selectedFile.name}`). You MUST keep these variables intact within the translated string.

Example:

English: `"status.applying": "Applying {selectedFile.name} → {destPath} ..."`

Translation (Estonian): `"status.applying": "Rakendatakse faili {selectedFile.name} → {destPath} ..."`

### The _META Section

Please ensure the `language` field reflects the native name of the language, as this is what is displayed to the user in the settings menu.
